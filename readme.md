LHTween
============

This is a small tweening library I built for Corona to add some more transitions to the alread existing set of transitinos.

The sample program shows a demo with red squares of the different looks, you can also view the easing curves below

you can get an interactive version of the chart by clicking [here](https://spreadsheets7.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en&hl=en&key=0AmmRIsKpMJd7dHRob0xBWWVXNGV0QWllSGF4S0ZJUkE&single=true&gid=0&output=html) 


To use simple replace the transition variable in your transitions (see the main.lua for examples).  This work was inspired by the 'tweener class' by Zeh Fernando and Nate Chatellier
